I do not care about your personal data. It is a waste of my time and frankly, I am too lazy to collect it. So basically, you owe your privacy to the fact that I dont care about it. I can barely even use Firebase (not saying I dont use it), but seriously, I don't care.

p.s.  but maybe I do care about you if I am not collecting your data?

tl;dr I don't care about you or your data

tl;dr2 I do care about you because I don't care about your data
